# sTJBot

a TJBot fork. that **s**ucks more.

Almost all improvements are related to the source code. not the actual functionality. although there are some functionality changes with TJBot and sTJBot, most notoriously the AI.

The source code that this bot was based from is [here](https://git.gay/TJC47/tjbotSLASH).

## The functionality changes

Some commands and features were removed.

- mee6 auto banning and flooding the chat with NTTS videos.

- /verify and /link. Might get re-added if they actually work.

- The AI. Removed because my hardware can't run AI so I can't test it. If i had good hardware i would definitely try to implement it. Sorry </3
